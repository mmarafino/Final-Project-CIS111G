# Final-Project-CIS111G

## Project Description
For my final project, I created an interactive spreadhseet based on a data set. The data set I chose to work with was U.S income statistics from 32,000+ communities in the United States and Puerto Rico. In the interactive section of the spreadsheet, it prompts a user to select a state from the dropdown menu and then provides the weighted summary statistics from communities within that selected region. The data is included in Kaggle_income_data tab in the spreadhseet and should not be changed. In addition, the MLA citations of the resources I used for this project are located in my project proposal document also in this repository.

## Spreadsheet Usage
1. Open the "Income Statistics by State" tab.
2. Select a state from the drop down menu next to the "State" label.
3. Below the drop down menu, the weighted summary statistics of the state you chose will be shown.
4. Specifically, the mean, median, and standard deviation of income for that selected area will be shown.
