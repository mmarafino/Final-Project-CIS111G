# Final-Project-CIS111G

## Project Description
For my final project, I created an interactive spreadhseet based on a data set. The data set I chose to work with was U.S income statistics from 32,000+ communities in the United States and Puerto Rico. In the interactive section of the spreadsheet, it prompts a user to select a state from the dropdown menu and then provides weighted summary statistics from communities within that selected region.
